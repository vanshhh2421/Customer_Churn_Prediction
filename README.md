# 📘 Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using various machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to leave a service, enabling businesses to take proactive retention measures.

The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook:
Customer_Churn_Prediction_using_ML.ipynb

🔍 Project Overview

Customer churn is a significant business challenge across many subscription-based industries. By analyzing customer behavior and demographic data, this project builds ML models that classify whether a customer will churn or not.

The notebook walks through:

Data loading

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data preprocessing

Feature engineering

Model building

Evaluation metrics

Final model selection

📂 Dataset

The dataset typically contains:

Customer demographic details

Account and subscription information

Usage behavior

Churn label (Yes/No)

(If your dataset has special/unique columns, share them and I’ll customize the README.)

🛠 Technologies Used

Python 3

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for EDA/visualization)

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

🧹 Data Preprocessing

Key preprocessing steps include:

Handling missing values

Encoding categorical features

Scaling numerical values

Splitting dataset into train & test sets

🤖 Machine Learning Models Used

Models typically evaluated:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Decision Tree

Support Vector Machine

K-Nearest Neighbors

Gradient Boosting / XGBoost (if applicable)

Each model is trained and evaluated using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1 Score

Confusion Matrix

(Tell me the exact models you used, and I’ll update this section.)

📊 Model Evaluation

The models are compared using:

Classification metrics

ROC curves

Feature importance (for tree-based models)

The best-performing model is selected based on overall performance and business interpretability.

🧾 Results

The final model achieved an accuracy of X%

Key features influencing churn include: A, B, C...

Customers with certain behavioral patterns were more likely to churn
